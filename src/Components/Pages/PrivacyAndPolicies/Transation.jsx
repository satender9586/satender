                  posted to a website hosted by Cloudedata or posted to this
                  Site). However, Cloudedata reserves the right (but undertakes

                  is appropriate and/or complies with this Agreement. Cloudedata
                  may remove any item of User Content (whether posted to a

                  terminate a User’s access to this Site or the Services found
                  at this Site for posting or publishing any material in

                  the Services or the Account (at Cloudedata’s sole discretion)

                  Site or the Services are used in a manner that promotes,
                  encourages or engages in child pornography, the exploitation
                  of children or terrorism, or (ii) Cloudedata has reason to
                  believe the User is a repeat offender. If Cloudedata
                  terminates your access to this Site, Services or the Account,
                  Cloudedata may, in its sole and absolute discretion, remove

                  stored by you on its servers. Please note that using one

                  indications of spamming. Customers suspected to be using our
                  products and services for the purpose of sending spam are
                  fully investigated. If we determine there is a problem with
                  spam, we will take the appropriate action to resolve the
                  situation. We define spam as the sending of Unsolicited
                  Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) or
                  Unsolicited Facsimiles (Fax), which is email or facsimile sent

                  We will not allow our servers and services to be used for the
                  purposes described above. In order to use our products and
                  services, you must not only abide by all applicable laws and
                  regulations but you must also abide by this no spam policy.
                  Commercial advertising and/or bulk emails or faxes may only be
                  sent to recipients who have “opted-in” to receive messages.
                  They must include a legitimate return address and reply-to
                  address, the sender's physical address, and an opt-out method
                  in the footer of the email or fax. Upon request by us,
                  conclusive proof of opt-in may be required for an email
                  address or fax number. If we determine the services in
                  question are being used in association with spam, we will
                  re-direct, suspend, or cancel any web site hosting, domain
                  registration, email boxes or other applicable services until
                  customer responds. The registrant or customer will be required
                  to respond by email to us stating that they will cease to send
                  spam and/or have spam sent on their behalf. In the event we
                  determine the abuse has not stopped after services have been
                  restored the first time, we may terminate the hosting and
                  email boxes associated with the domain name in question. We
                  encourage all customers and recipients of email generated from
                  our products and services to report suspected spam. Suspected
                  abuse can be reported by email care@Cloudedata.com. Liquidated
                  Damages. You agree that we may immediately terminate any
                  Account which we believe, in our sole and absolute discretion,
                  is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any spam or

                  You agree that your Payment Method may be charged by one of
                  our affiliated entities. If, during your purchase, your
                  payment was identified as being processed in Lithuania, your
                  transaction will be processed by CLOUDEDATA, registered at

                <p>
                  (A) GENERAL TERMS, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC RENEWAL TERMS By
                  purchasing our Services, you agree to provide correct and full
                  payment related information (including information required
                  for tax exemptions, such as GST number). Any claims or
                  requests will be handled only if they are provided not later
                  than within 30 days of the date of purchase, unless applicable
                  laws provide otherwise. If you use automatic payments, you
                  will always need to have one payment method that's designated
                  as a primary. You can also add a backup payment method to your
                  account that will be used if your primary payment method does
                  not work for some reason. In case your primary method does not
                  work, we will automatically charge your costs to your backup
                  payment method in order to ensure that your Services keep
                  running. You agree to pay any and all prices and fees due for
                  Services purchased or obtained at this Site at the time you
                  order the Services. All prices and fees are non-refundable
                  unless otherwise expressly noted in the Refund Policy section
                  below, even if your Services are suspended, terminated, or
                  transferred prior to the end of the Services term. Cloudedata
                  expressly reserves the right to change or modify its prices
                  and fees at any time, and such changes or modifications shall
                  be posted online at this Site and effective immediately
                  without need for further notice to you. If you have purchased
                  or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes
                  or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when
                  the Services in question come up for renewal as further
                  described below. Except as prohibited in any product-specific
                  agreement, you may pay for Services by utilizing any of the
                  following “Payment Methods”: (i) by providing a valid credit
                  card, (ii) by using PayPal (as defined below), or (iii) via
                  in-store credit balances, if applicable (and as defined
                  below), each a “Payment Method”. For Services that offer
                  “Express Checkout”, clicking the Express Checkout button will
                  automatically place an order for that Service and charge the
                  primary Payment Method on file for your Account. Confirmation
                  of that order will be sent to the email address on file for
                  your Account. Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid
                  if you have any active Services in your Account. You
                  acknowledge and agree that where refunds are issued to your
                  Payment Method, Cloudedata's issuance of a refund receipt is
                  only confirmation that Cloudedata has submitted your refund to
                  the Payment Method charged at the time of the original sale,
                  and that Cloudedata has absolutely no control over when the
                  refund will be applied towards your Payment Method’s available
                  balance. You further acknowledge and agree that the payment
                  provider and/or individual issuing bank associated with your
                  Payment Method establish and regulate the time frames for
                  posting your refund, and that such refund posting time frames
                  may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle,
                  or longer. In the event a refund is issued to your Payment
                  Method and the payment provider, payment processor or
                  individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method
                  imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited
                  to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number
                  of refunds allowed, then Cloudedata, in its sole and absolute
                  discretion, reserves the right to issue the refund in the form
                  of an in-store credit. Cloudedata also has the right, but not
                  the obligation, to offer an in-store credit for customers
                  seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds
                  imposed by the Payment Method. For the avoidance of doubt, any
                  and all refunds processed via the issuance of in-store
                  creditsare solely within Cloudedata’s discretion and are not
                  available at customer request. In order to ensure that you do
                  not experience an interruption or loss of Services, most
                  Services offer an automatic renewal option. The automatic
                  renewal option automatically renews the applicable Service for
                  a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service
                  period, except for domain names which will renew for the
                  original service period. For example, for products other than
                  domains, if your last service period is for one year, your
                  renewal period will be for one year. We have the right, but
                  not an obligation, to inform you via email about the upcoming
                  automatic renewal date (e.g. we will not send notifications
                  for clients having 1 month plans). While the details of the
                  automatic renewal option vary from Service to Service, the
                  Services that offer an automatic renewal option treat it as
                  the default setting. Therefore, unless you disable the
                  automatic renewal option, Cloudedata will automatically renew
                  the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will
                  take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with
                  Cloudedata at Cloudedata’s then current rates, which you
                  acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates
                  for the original service period. In order to see the renewal
                  settings applicable to you and your Services, simply log into
                  your members area and find the respective account. You may
                  enable or disable the automatic renewal option at any time.
                  However, should you elect to disable the automatic renewal
                  option and fail to manually renew your Services before they
                  expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of
                  Services, and Cloudedata shall not be liable to you or any
                  third party regarding the same. In addition, Cloudedata may
                  participate in “recurring billing programs” or “account
                  updater services” supported by your credit card provider (and
                  ultimately dependent on your bank’s participation). If you are
                  enrolled in an automatic renewal option and we are unable to
                  successfully charge your existing Payment Method, your credit
                  card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your
                  credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may
                  automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf
                  without notification to us. In accordance with recurring
                  billing program requirements, in the event that we are
                  notified of an update to your credit card number and/or
                  expiration date, Cloudedata will automatically update your
                  payment profile on your behalf. Cloudedata makes no guarantees
                  that we will request or receive updated credit card
                  information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole
                  responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings,
                  including but not limited to (i) setting your renewal options
                  and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are
                  current and valid. Further, you acknowledge and agree that
                  your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss
                  of Services, and Cloudedata shall not be liable to you or any
                  third party regarding the same. If for any reason Cloudedata
                  is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount
                  owed for the Services provided, or if Cloudedata receives
                  notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is
                  charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your
                  Payment Method, you agree that Cloudedata may pursue all
                  available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment,
                  including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without
                  notice to you, of any domain names or Services registered or
                  renewed on your behalf. Cloudedata also reserves the right to
                  charge you reasonable “administrative fees” or “processing
                  fees” for (i) tasks Cloudedata may perform outside the normal
                  scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs
                  Cloudedata may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii)
                  your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by
                  Cloudedata in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical
                  administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are
                  not limited to (i) customer service issues that require
                  additional personal time or attention; (ii) UDRP actions(s) in
                  connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that
                  require accounting or legal services, whether performed by
                  Cloudedata staff or by outside firms retained by Cloudedata;
                  (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost
                  of Services, incurred by Cloudedata as the results of
                  chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your
                  bank or Payment Method processor. These administrative fees or
                  processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have
                  on file with Cloudedata. Cloudedata may offer product-level
                  pricing in various currencies; however, transaction processing
                  is supported only in Rupees. If the currency selected is a
                  Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in
                  the Supported Currency and the pricing displayed during the
                  checkout process will be the actual amount processed and
                  submitted to your bank for payment. If the currency selected
                  is not a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be
                  processed in Indian Rupees and the pricing displayed during
                  the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at
                  the time of purchase. In either case (whether the currency
                  selected is a Supported Currency or not), if the transaction
                  is processed in a currency that differs from the currency of
                  your bank account, you may be charged exchange rate conversion
                  fees by your bank. In addition, due to time differences
                  between (i) the time you complete the checkout process, (ii)
                  the time the transaction is processed, and (iii) the time the
                  transaction posts to your bank statement, the conversion rates
                  may fluctuate, and Cloudedata makes no representations or
                  warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank for
                  payment will be the same as the amount posted to your bank
                  statement (in the case of a Supported Currency) or (b) the
                  estimated conversion price will be the same as either the
                  amount processed or the amount posted to your bank statement
                  (in the case of a non-Supported Currency), and you agree to
                  waive any and all claims based upon such discrepancies
                  (including any and all claims for a refund based on the
                  foregoing). In addition, regardless of the selected currency,
                  you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added
                  Tax ("VAT"), Goods and Services Tax ("GST"), or other
                  localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the
                  country indicated in your billing address section. Refund
                  Policy: (“Refund Policy”). For products and services eligible
                  for a refund, you may request a full refund within thirty (30)
                  days of purchase (“Refund Period”). In the event you purchase
                  a product that includes a free domain name, if you cancel the
                  product, the list price for the domain name will be deducted
                  from the refund amount. The list price is the price of the
                  domain name listed on Cloudedata’s website and is not subject
                  to any promotion, discount, or other reduction in price. In no
                  event will you be eligible for more than one refund of the
                  same product.

                <p>
                  (B) INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS Cloudedata offers a variety
                  of alternative international payment options through a variety
                  of International Payment Providers (“IPP”). In the event you
                  select an IPP, you represent that you have already agreed to
                  any and all of the IPP’s applicable customer service
                  agreements in advance of completing your transaction at
                  Cloudedata. You also agree to allow the IPP to debit the full
                  amount of your purchase from the selected bank account,
                  e-wallet account (including credit card(s), bank account(s),
                  or other allowed payment method(s) linked to your e-wallet
                  account) or any other type of account associated with the
                  selected IPP (including but not limited to, prepaid cards and
                  mobile payments), collectively “Funding Sources”. In addition,
                  you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit, if applicable,
                  an “Exchange Rate Conversion Fee”, as well as any other fees
                  or charges applicable to your agreement with the IPP
                  (collectively, the “IPP Fees”), from your Funding Sources. You
                  understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at
                  any time by the IPP without notice to you by Cloudedata. It is
                  your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and
                  funded. You acknowledge and agree that (i) the IPP reserves
                  the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including,
                  but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a
                  result of your Funding Sources no longer existing or not
                  holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event,
                  neither the IPP nor Cloudedata shall be liable to you or any
                  third party regarding the same. You acknowledge that
                  Cloudedata will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased
                  by you until Cloudedata receives confirmation of payment from
                  the IPP through its associated payment processor. You
                  acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days
                  between the time you place an order and the time the IPP
                  confirms payment through its associated payment processor. If
                  Cloudedata does not receive confirmation of payment from the
                  IPP through its associated payment processor within thirty
                  (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be
                  cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the
                  purchase process again. In the event that you would like to
                  cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the
                  order through your Cloudedata account. Payments received on
                  previously cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to
                  the original Payment Method when possible. If, at the time
                  Cloudedata receives confirmation of payment from the IPP
                  (through its associated payment processor), either (i) the
                  Services (including domain names) are no longer available for
                  purchase; or (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our
                  systems; or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match
                  the Rupees amount of the pending order, and as a result your
                  purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, Cloudedata may
                  automatically issue a partial refund (in the case of
                  over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding)
                  to your Funding Source. If the IPP (or its associated payment
                  processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, Cloudedata
                  reserves the right to issue refunds to an in-store credit
                  balance. If you receive a full refund, you will need to begin
                  the purchase process again. You acknowledge and agree that the
                  IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with
                  a refunded transaction. Accordingly, any refunds issued by
                  Cloudedata will be net of the IPP Fees unless otherwise
                  specified.
